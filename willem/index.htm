Bert writes May 2009:<br>
I can tell you something about my brother Jan. He was at one of the Amsterdam universities studying physics when at the age of about 25 he started to have strange ideas. He became very religious in his own way. He also thought very peculiar about women. They should not wear trousers for instance. He did not use stamps on which our queen was portrayed. In a way he was old fashioned. At that time he started to work on family trees. Also for other families and earned a kind of living that way. We almost had no contact with him. He died in 1994. Afterwards we think that he was schizophrenic. He did not use a tracing tool to create the pictures. Those pictures are not in my online family tree.<br>
<br>
My father is Hendrik Heijns, my grandfather Jan Heijns. He died in March 1945. That winter (1944-45) was called &quot;hongerwinter&quot; in the west of Holland which was still occupied by the Germans. There was no food and no coal, gas &nbsp;or firewood to heat the house. My grandfather was taking the furniture apart for the wood and doing this he hurt his head so severely that he died.&nbsp;Shortly after the war we received parcels with clothes and food from <a href="http://familytrees.net/familytrees/heyns/gerrit.htm">Garrett Heijns</a> who lived in Grand Rapids.<br>

I visited the homepage you&#39;re involved in on the Heyns family tree. Very interesting!!!! I am a Heijns myself and my family lives in the Ter Aar region, Netherlands.<br>
<br>
My name is Anne Claire Heijns (born Alphen aan den Rijn, 1975), daughter of Dirk Heijns (born Ter Aar, 1947), granddaughter of Pieter Willem Heijns (born Ter Aar, 1911) descending from Willem Wijnandt Heijns who, as I was told, came to Holland from Hannover, Germany. I once saw a family tree that went back to the time Wijnandt Heijns came from Germany, but didn&#39;t know anything more. Until I saw your website! I see there is not so many Dutch people on your mailing list, but both me and my father would be very interested. Can we become part of the list, or contribute in some way?<br>
<br>
Greetings from a far-away cousin,<br>
